# á›Ÿ minc | Minimalistic C Language
`Min> C <niM`  
MinC is a minimalistic C language with nim syntax.  
It does not try to be feature-full, its only goal is to write Modern and Pure C.  

See the @[What is MinC](./doc/minc.md) doc file for an overview of the lang.

### Current State of Development
TL;DR: **Early** :)
```md
The language works, and can create full applications.  

The current way to work with the language involves continuously hitting assertions,  
with very little (or at times none) error information, other than the backtrace and a treeRepr of the code that crashed.  

See the todo and done folders for a complete list of features implemented and tbd.  
There is also a roadmap file, used for version planning and goal-setting.

Full application example @[app03 Framebuffer OpenGL](./examples/app03_framebufferGL)  

### Compiler
MinC uses an StoS compiler that generates C code.  
The generated output code is standard, human-readable and editable C code.  
The output code is then compiled with a regular C compiler as usual.  

MinC can be used to create C libraries, because the output is normal C code.  

Cross-compilation is a first class citizen.  
Thanks to the internal usage of the ZigCC compiler interface,  
building for any target is as easy as passing `-target=` to the compiler command.
