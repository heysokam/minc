# Notes
? ? ? versions mean that their number has not been decided.

This list is a timeline. Time forward means moving downwards along the list.
Which means that Tasks are listed in reverse order, instead of below their corresponding title.
 -> To arrive at 0.9.0, all previously listed tasks must be completed.
  : Tasks listed under its label are meant for the next step (1.0.0) not for 0.9.0

Comments/Description right under a label are relevant only to the label right above  (not the content after)
  : (the list/content belongs to the next roadmap label).
