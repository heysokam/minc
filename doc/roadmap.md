# Notes
? ? ? versions mean that their number has not been decided.

This list is a timeline. Time forward means moving downwards along the list.
Which means that Tasks are listed in reverse order, instead of below their corresponding title.
 -> To arrive at 0.9.0, all previously listed tasks must be completed.
  : Tasks listed under its label are meant for the next step (1.0.0) not for 0.9.0

Comments/Description right under a label are relevant only to the label right above  (not the content after)
  : (the list/content belongs to the next roadmap label).

Note:
  Its really hard to organize C features into versions
  Raising version to v0.1.0 has been randomnly chosen after app03_framebufferGL was achieved
  Almost all of the important things are already there, but they have a lot of broken cases
  The decision feels rushed, but... its gonna be arbitrary anyway
  Not sure if proper version structuring for C features is worth the effort,
  but will keep thinking of a better solution while progress continues
# 0.1.0 First Publishable
The language works, and can create complete applications.
Effort on supporting the entire feature-set of C continues until 0.9.0
