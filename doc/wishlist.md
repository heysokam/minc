Strong typing

Replace #ifdef -> When
Replace C Macros:
- Generics
- Typed Templates
Better doc strictness

Better C:
Language defined instead of implementation defined is the biggest problem.
Bitfields, signed overflow etc.
C is not missing anything really. It just needs to be cleaned up and leaner. Less features over all.
Add slices, better strings, better macros, maybe type info, and maybe defer
Be very careful adding features, otherwise you will need to add more features to solve other feature's problems.
