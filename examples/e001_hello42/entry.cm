# Simplest program possible
# Creates the main function, and returns a hardcoded value

proc main *() :int= return 42    # int main(void) { return 42; }

# Note:
# Rules for `main`:
# - Must always be marked as public with `*`,
#   Otherwise it would become `static int main(void)` which is illegal in C
# - There can only be one `main` in all modules
