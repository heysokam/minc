# C libraries can be included as they are
# Remember: MinC does not need C bindings, because MinC is C
include "<stdint.h>"   #->    #include <stdint.h>

# stdint introduces a new type, called `int32_t`
# So now we can use it literally, because its a valid C symbol
proc main *() :int32_t=
  return 42
# int32_t main(void) { return 42; }
